##Sourcery

Sourcery is a Rails app that makes collaborating on research projects easier for students and teachers. Sign in with a Gmail account, then get sharing! 

With Sourcery, users can share articles, documents, and videos, as well as join research groups and follow other users. Not sure where to start on a project? Query the New York Times for article suggestions that you can then save to your resources and share with your group. When you're ready to start compiling and synthesizing your ideas, export your comments to PDF or create a Google Doc that gets added to your Google Drive right from our application.
